		<h1>About Cheese University</h1>
		<h2>Best School EVER!!</h2>
		<p>Cheese University has a long standing tradition of serving cheese 
		lover in the world. Our history stretches way back to two days ago when 
		the great mind of Andrew Edwards decided that there just had to be a 
		university as ridiculous as this one. It was a long hard struggle to 
		create this university.
				</p>
		<p>Brand new to the world of Expression Web 4 software, Andrew plugged 
		along, early into the dawn of each new day in the hopes of create 
		something that wasn't quite as devastatingly ugly as the R'lyeh Rising 
		website. He search many a forum in hopes of finding tips and suggestions 
		and finally came up with this particular design while watching a 
		tutorial on YouTube.
				</p>
		<p>It constantly amazes us, here at Cheese University, that the 
		internets can contain so much absolutely wonderful content, free for the 
		consumption of inquiring minds, yet inevitably, these minds will end up 
		melting as they watch that next episode of anime or that stupid little 
		cat playing the piano. May as well have a university devoted to cheese 
		while we are creating a repository of all human knowledge.
				</p>
		<p>So watch half a music video of a good group of friends, and know, 
		deep down in your soul, the internets are serious business.
				</p>
